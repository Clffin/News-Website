                            <h6><em>By: Cliffin Joseph</em></h6>
                        </div>
                        <h4> Introduction</h4>
                        <p> The story for this website was meant to be niche, targetting gamers in particular. 
                            Initially I had a gamer themed website with relevant articles but due to the lack of open sourced game related articles, 
                            I had to sacrifice quality. This website is loosly based of my own gaming company "Lobby Zero" which is a collaborative 
                            project designed to popularize gaming in India. We have social media accounts for the company but we did not have a website. 
                            So, I took this oppertunity to create a website that would act as a magazine company that mirrors my own company. This website 
                            contains articles that I find interesting, as well as videos and pictures from my social media account.</p>
                        <h4> Inspiration</h4>
                        <p> For this particular website, I wanted to make the website both aesthetic like a newsletter as well as more playful to appeal 
                            to gamers. For article design I surfed through multiple magazine website of companies such as GQ, and based my design off of 
                            my favourite aspects of each site. I also watched youtube videos of multple web developers to get inspiration</p>
                        <h4> Accessibility</h4>
                        <p> Making this website accessible was a bit tricky. I first had to understand what an accessible website is, and figure out how 
                            to implement it limited to my capabilities. Firstly, I used alt attributes for every image diplayed on my website, which allows 
                            screen reader softwares to read out the description of the images. I also used colors that with a wide contrast to accomodate possible 
                            color blind audiences. Initially the colors did not have that much of a contrast to make the website look aesthetic, but I realized that 
                            certain texts may not be visible to those who are colorblind.</p> 
                        <h4> Usability</h4>
                        <p> To determine the usability of a website, we need to first need the understand the goal of the website. My website serves as newsletter 
                            for the gaming world. So, in order to achieve good usability, the navigation, content locating, and overall structure of the website must 
                            be easy to use. To avoid confusion, the navigation bar only has a few options that brings you to where you would need to go. The footer is 
                            also pretty standard and well described to allow users to navigate with ease. Each link and button is well highlighted which hovered over 
                            to show its presence to the users. The article cards were also given a shadow when hovered upon to indicate that those cards are clickable 
                            and lead to the article. </p>
                        <h4>Learning</h4>
                        <p> In order to create this site on my own, I resorted to youtube videos and websites such as 'W3schools'. My understanding of the grid and 
                            flexbox layouts were not strong, so I had to relearn them by creating practice websites and testing each property. Using bootstrap is still 
                            confusing to me so I refrained from using the codes from it's libraries as much as I could. 
                            
                            In order to create animations, I needed to use refernces such as 'W3schools' as well as some youtube videos to have a grasp on the basics 
                            of animation.</p>  
                        <h4>Evaluation 1</h4>
                        <p> When we talk about success it definitly is subjective, but for someone that is not very confident in coding, I believe the overall aesthetic 
                            of the website was well achieved. I believe I did a good job creating a simple yet attractive layout to my homepage as well as the article 
                            page. The homepage looked aesthetic enough for my gamer friends to be drawn to it and considering the fact that they fit into my target 
                            audience, that aspect of my website is considered a success. When it comes to the articles, they layout and styles used provided a simple 
                            yet professional design that made my target audience feel like reading article.<p>
                        <h4>Evaluation 2</h4>   
                        <p> I believe I could have added more elements into each webpage to make it more robust but I was unable to add some elements due to certain 
                            bugs in the codes. I believe could have made the website more accessible. I read many articles and tutorials explaining how to integrate 
                            text to speech functions into the code but given the timeframe I was not succesful in implementing them. Doing this assignment I realized 
                            that I spent too much time working on the aesthetic and design of the website instead of the functionalities. If I had the oppertunity to 
                            do this assignment all over again, I would have focused more on adding more functions and elements into the website once I had the base 
                            layout of the website. I also think that the article content could have been improved but I was unable to find a wide range of open access 
                            articles related to gaming. </p>
